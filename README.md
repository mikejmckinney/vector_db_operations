# vector_db_operations
This repository provides a sample Python project that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on text documents stored in a vector database. It uses [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) as the backend and [SentenceTransformer](https://www.sbert.net/) for generating embeddings.
